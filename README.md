# BB-8 Robot  
##### Keep Calm and May the Force Be With You  

## Overview  
This repository contains both codes and CAD model for the BB-8 robot. The main goal of this project is to redesign BB-8 robot’s inner mechanism, as well as the control algorithm, to improve its balance. A two-wheel self-balancing robot was built and tested first. After then, we reassemble it to the final BB-8 robot by changing the chassis and adding other components. STM32F407 was used as the microcontroller in this project, while CubeMX was utilized for STM32’s configuration and FreeRTOS was implemented as the kennel. /Model includes all the parts for both self-balancing car and our final BB-8 robot (based on SolidWorks 2018). Other electron components and stuffs are listed in /reference.
